 Rated 4 out of 5  Nice warm sound but.....  nice chorus pedal, sounds great and easy to use , however, mine makes a "pop" sound when engaged. the foot switch is a true bypass but is not wired in an optimal way. Correcting the switch wiring proved difficult because the switch is soldered directly to the pc card, and the card is double sided. So here is an easy solution to this problem and no more popping. the 2 resistors are 2.2 Meg. I included a photo for the location of the resistors. Works great now!  two 2.2 Meg resistors * Was this review helpful? Yes ( ) No ( )
