##  Product Description

 Add an extra note of luxury to bath time with this soft spa towel. It's made from pure cotton, with the 650 gsm weight making it thick and absorbent. Pamper yourself or give someone an indulgent gift. 

 This towel’s GSM rating is 650 GSM. GSM stands for grams per square metre and indicates the weight and density of the towel. Our towels range from 450-800 GSM. At the lower end of the scale, 450-600 GSM signifies a lightweight towel: good value and quick-drying, with added benefits such as low-twist yarn to make them feel more like their heavier-weight counterparts. At the higher end of the scale, 600-800 GSM signifies a heavier, more luxurious towel. The pile in these deluxe towels is denser and more lavish. Towels at the lower end of this range are great for everyday use, while those at the higher end resemble the towels you’d find in a luxury hotel.

 Beautiful quality towels. They have washed well.i was unsure about the colour, but realised they are a light duck egg. Now I have started to use the set, I really like the subtle colour.

 I had already purchased 2 of the bath sheets. They are excellent quality so decided to buy two more and also some hand towels. Bought them when on offer. Well worth the money.

####  Fluffy Towels

 Average rating: 3 out of 5 

 hzlbrd  August 2022 

 No, I don't recommend this 

 Washed before use but the fluff still came off and went everywhere. White bedding now covered in navy fluff! Bought online in sale and when received there were several large catches in one of the towels. They seem a reasonable thickness so hopefully the ‘fluff problem’ will disappear and I’ll have lovely, soft towels.

####  Disappointing towels

 Average rating: 3 out of 5 

 Lizziewasp  August 2022 

 I bought these as they were reduced by 50% not having bought M&S towels previously but I would not have paid full price for them. Not all that soft and fluff everywhere shall stick to JL in future.
