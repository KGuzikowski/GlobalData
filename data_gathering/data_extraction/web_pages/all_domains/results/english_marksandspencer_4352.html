 Lumint  Profile - Curvy on top and 5′4  August 2022 

 Yes, I recommend this 

 Lovely shirt; well made and washes beautifully. It is definitely an oversized fit which is what I wanted but I would have sized down for something a bit more professional looking. I don’t like the buttons, I think they’re too large but they’re sewn on well with thread that matches the shirt fabric. That’s me being particular though because I always prefer buttons (and zips) to be as small, neat and inconspicuous as possible; matching the fabric rather than being in contrast. Per Una clothes are my worst nightmare!

 DGax  Profile - Athletic and 6′0  July 2022 

 Its VERY big! I would recommend sizing down x 2 - material light but not cotton but cool in warmer weather - can crease a lot

 No, I don't recommend this 

 A little bit big and shapeless. Good to wear over t-shirt on cooler summer days . Nice colour but paler than looks on website

 Yes, I recommend this 

 Feels like a work shirt, a few sizes up. Was expecting thicker material and the cuffs are a bit narrow for rolling up. But nice colour and collar is crisp
