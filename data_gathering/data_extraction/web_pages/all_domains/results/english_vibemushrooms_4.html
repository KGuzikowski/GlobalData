 “Red What??”  Say it with us now: “Red RAY-SHEE”. That’s it!  Adaptogens are metabolic regulators which increase the ability of an organism to adapt to environmental stressors and prevent damage to the organism by such stressors. Genrally speaking, adaptogens increase your state of resistance to stress and decrease your sensitivity to stressors. 

 As an ADAPTOGEN, this lady-in-red can adapt to many needs for your overall health and well-being. Reishi, can support your body’s natural response to stress, improve sleep, and blunt anxiety and fatigue. Chill TF out and relax with one of the most potent extracts in our tribe. No bad vibes here, Diana!
