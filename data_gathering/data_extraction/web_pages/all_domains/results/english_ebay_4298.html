Take on the role of Ripley's clone and three other characters in Alien Resurrection, a first-person shooter based on the 1997 film.

The game is set throughout the ship Auriga and there are a variety aliens in their various forms of gestation to battle, as well as military personnel who've been ordered to silence Ripley permanently. Many familiar items from the movies will be available during the course of the game, including the familiar motion tracker that sounds a telltale beep when danger is at hand.

 See all 12 reviews * 4 out of 5 stars  by iKPZyGgVQIm@Del...  Sep 09, 2006 ####  Scary game. do not play at night seriously

 Alien Trilogy was the first on PSX to bring us the horror and adventure of the three Alien's movies that have become cult classics. Alien Resurrection brings us the final events of the movie series in the first person shooter format that Alien Trilogy brought us. What this title brings to the table is a game that is dark and moody, offering you up some different characters with different weapons, a ton of puzzles and some good old fashioned alien blasting in the process! Most fans of the movie will see that the locations of the game are a little bit off, but the overall feel of the game is there from the start with the amount of shadows and otherwise that you encounter throughout the game. With the addition of surround sound extensive effects and music, you’ll be immersed into the world of  Alien Resurrection without much of a problem, as long as the lights are down low, the music is up high and you don’t have anyone interrupting you while you play! Ah...the days of the first person shooters live on. Done much in the style of Doom, Quake, and other first person games, it features you as the survivor on a ship filled with death in the form of Alien killing machines. There is a slight twist; you can change your characters from one to another depending on the level you're on. This adds a different bit of gameplay, considering that only certain characters can use certain weapons! For instance, one of the characters from the movie uses a dual pistol that is strapped to each arm...well, the only character in the game that can use dual pistols, is that same movie character. All characters can be switched up at small communication stations. New to the Alien game saga, is the introduction of the Chestburster meter; when you are infected by an Alien Face Hugger, you're implanted with an embryo, much like in the movies...then a meter will appear with a disappearing bar. You have just a certain amount of time before you're player is dead from the Chestburster exploding from his/her chest. Pretty cool addition! The gameplay itself is your usual run 'n gun gameplay, with Aliens crawling, hurling, jumping, and all out running at you. However, it's not just one here, and one there...when you step into the mix, you get them all at once, and it's be quick, or be dead. With the look feature, you can see ahead of you...and do watch your Motion Tracker...you'll need it when you start getting closer to the bad guys. The little screen in the lower left hand corner will blip when you get closer to an Alien, and then go to a high-pitched scream when you {or they} are on top of you! As with most Doom-style games, Alien Resurrection supports the usual functions that a first person shooting game does. It gives you a firing button, weapon selections, item selections and the essential look buttons {Up/Down, Left/Right}. With that being said, AR also supports the mouse feature, but, most gamers out there don't have one of these to play with, and it can be cumbersome to try and play with both the mouse and the controller using the analog stick as your movement and other buttons on the PSX controller as your item selection. Outside of the massive amounts of buttons, the control is near perfect!  Read full review
* 4 out of 5 stars  by mad\_planet\_coll...  Sep 05, 2008 ####  Alien Resurrection (Playstation 1)

 This review will read much like my review of the Playstation 1 Alien Trilogy video game: Well, what can I say? It's a Playstation 1 title. So with that said, I guess you would have to be a "retro-gamer" and an Alien fan like myself to fully enjoy the game. The main reason that I purchased this Playstation 1 game was because I am a HUGE Alien movie franchise fan. Plus, there aren't any video games of this nature available for my Wii or Playstation 2 game consoles. As in, no Aliens first person shooter (FPS) games for either system. As for the game, it's your basic first person shooter (FPS) video game. I rate it as good, as the graphics and the game controls are a lot better then it's predecessor, Alien Triolgy. I really only suggest this game to  die-hard Alien fans that want a challenging controlled game and can stomach the large pixels of a Playstation 1 game. Though, this time around, both the graphics and controls are a bit more tolerable, but not by much. Buy at your own risk.  Read full review
* 5 out of 5 stars  by engleburt\_googe...  Nov 18, 2018 ####  Replacement cases were exactly what I needed!

 I needed replacement cases for Aliens Trilogy and Alien Resurrection as I had purchased the discs but they didn't come in their original cases. And if you're looking to get the original cases get ready to shell out some money. Well I jumped on eBay and saw these beauties and they completely fit the bill. Plus they even included artwork for the inside! I couldn't be happier!

* 5 out of 5 stars  by awesumbid  Oct 16, 2009 ####  Still one of the best 1st. per. shtrs. in PlayStation..

 Although 'Alien Resurrection' is dated(original PlayStationI), the game concept and easy functionality makes it still one of the best game titles ever.IMO Other first person shooters in a war setting like 'Call of Duty' or 'SOCOM: Navy Seals' are ok, but I prefer this genre of action, adventure, suspense. That is why I like practically everything about it and would rate it in the top 5 games. Maybe 'Splinter Cell' or 'Dead Space' could beat it but not much else. The game coincides with the movie of the same name and you play first as Ripley then Call(Wynona Rider's character) then back to Ripley and so on. There are two other playable characters: DiStephano(a Marine assigned to duty on the USM Auriga) and Christie(a mercenary an  d crewmember of the Betty which is how Call is also aboard the Auriga). The game starts with Ripley in a containment cell somewhere aboard the USM Auriga and, contacting and switching to the other players as you go, you must find your way through the ship. All the while, of course, trying not to get killed by facehuggers, chestbursters, aliens, bigger and meaner aliens, alien queen, and a nasty thing called a newborn. Unless you are very good, at some point in time, you will have been facehugged and counting down until an alien bursts from your chest! That and other things like the dark, shadowy scenery and secondary noises that go off at the worst times is why I like it so much and decided to buy it. The only thing I could find fault with is the lack of new events that are different after you save, begin new or get killed. AI is the term I guess.  Read full review
* 5 out of 5 stars  by cherubim\*  Jul 25, 2017 ####  Retro games

 This game takes me back to my childhood. If you liked the movie (I thought it was okay...but loved the movie series, ESPECIALLY Alien 1 & 2), then this game is for you. The graphics are good too considering it is for the first playstation.
