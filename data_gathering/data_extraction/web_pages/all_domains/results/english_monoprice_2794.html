 0  I don't think it may be a wise choice to do so. There are some size differences between the cables plus if you're wanting that style keystone they do have it in the cat5e version. Here is the product number Product ID: 15686 Also, one thing to mention about the keystones, you will need the punch down tool with the Krone style blade, because the terminal pins are at angles. Most of the punch down tools have the flip blade. I hope this helps you. * Reply

 0  Yes they would. These are not metal/grounded though, so if you were doing Cat6A, you might reconsider. (But based on what I researched briefly, you could use these for Cat6A too; just ground the other side of this cable at the patch panel) * Reply

 Vote for the best answer above!  Will this work with stranded wire or only solid wire?  Mason K  on Jul 29, 2020  BEST ANSWER:  They should work, although stranded wire is tougher to get fully punched down in the keystone. Solid wire is designed for in-wall applications with keystones. Stranded wire is typically better suited for patch cables since it's more flexible than solid wire. * Reply

 Does anyone know of a speed punch down tool that works well with these jacks? I have ordered two now like the SpeedTerm Tool for Networx SpeedTerm 180 Degree Keystone Jacks by Networx and the jacks do not fit. If I have to use one like the Cable Matters 110 Punch Down Tool with 110 blade that does each wire at a time then so be it but I was hoping for something faster since I have to do 100+ connections.

 Rated 5 out of 5  Works for my needs  These Keystones worked perfectly for my needs. I am currently in the process of redoing my network closet and I decided to go with an actual patch panel that used keystones and I also rewired the home using in-wall keystones plates. I had no problems terminating my connection points throughout the home and the closet. I did notice that these keystones are not the 110 type but are the krone type, which wasn't a problem since I had that tool in my kit. Now I have much more ease and flexibility in case I have to repair or add additional cable. * Was this review helpful? Yes ( ) No ( )
