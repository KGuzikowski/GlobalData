 Truck looks much better after the install. Installation requires a strut spring compressor. I loaned one from Autozone for free! Installation time took about 2-3 hours.

 The factory rake in the Chevy Colorado is too much. Adding the Rough Country level kit makes the truck sit like it should be from the factory.

 I purchased these but then changed my direction of the way I wanted to handle the front leveling of my '17 Silverado. I contacted Autoanything this morning to get a Return Authorization for the kit, so I can put the strut-top spacers on instead .

 this lift gave my 2017 titan a little above level for the front, just what I was looking for. This was a simple and easy kit to install and looks great!  Appearance  Ease of Installation  Price/Value  Quality  Posted By James J ( Ozark , AL ) / December 18, 2017  2017 Nissan Titan  Was this review helpful?  Yes  No ##  Raising my Ford

 Put a Fisher V-plow on my Ford F-350. Thought it would carry it better! Needed to raise the front end. Looked at different options. Chose the 2'' leveling kit from Rough Country. Easy install.(I am an auto tech with air tools) Can be done at home would just take longer. Threw on a pair of Timbren load boosters and it all works great! Will give a thumbs up to the Rough Country leveling kits!  Appearance  Ease of Installation  Price/Value  Quality  Posted By Kevin S ( JAY , NY ) / November 25, 2017  2010 Ford F-350  Was this review helpful?  Yes  No ##  Great Product, Awesome Stance

 I wanted something to give my truck a better stance compared to stock, but didn't want something obnoxious. This leveling kit was the perfect fit. The truck looks great, rides as good as factory, and the extra 2" up front is nice. The stance is aggressive and I can not fit a larger tire. I had a shop do the work and the install took them 2 hours w/alignment. Highly recommend.  Appearance  Ease of Installation  Price/Value  Quality  Posted By Jason C ( ALGONQUIN , IL ) / September 19, 2017  2016 Chevy Silverado  Was this review helpful?  Yes  No ##  2001 Sierra 2WD

 The kit does exactly what it is supposed to do, level out the truck. However, if you're planning on installing new springs (like I did) at the same time, be prepared to use an internal spring compressor. Old springs sag and tend to compress even more with a leveling kit. Installing new springs at the time of the leveling kit install on an old truck is cheap insurance to ensure you get the look that you want.
