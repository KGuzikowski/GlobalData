    "not much to say... strip the outer skin of the wire, follow the color codes, punchdown the wires, snap into a wall plate, then you're in business. This was priced right and it just works.",
    "Worked Well. Reasonably easy to install with a punchdown tool.",
    "On Q type",
    "Great quality cat6 keystones, exactly what I needed.",
    "horribly unreliable",
    "Great cat6 jack at a great price.",
    "The worst keystone jacks I've ever used. Over a quarter of them failed and I still have some that lose the connection if the cable moves even a little. Pure crap.",
    "Great product. I Have used these several times. The fit and function are just what you would expect. Price is 1/4 of what the local stores wanted.",
    "This keystone is narrower than others, allowing it to fit into Product #6837 (2-gang 12 position keystone wall plate) with no issues! These worked great for my application and punched down just fine."
