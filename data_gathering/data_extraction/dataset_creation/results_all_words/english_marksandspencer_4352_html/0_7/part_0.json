    "Lovely shirt fits perfectly, well made and good value.",
    "Large oversized shirt ordered a ten was still too big and colours darker than advertised sent back",
    "Lovely shirt; well made and washes beautifully. It is definitely an oversized fit which is what I wanted but I would have sized down for something a bit more professional looking. I don’t like the buttons, I think they’re too large but they’re sewn on well with thread that matches the shirt fabric. That’s me being particular though because I always prefer buttons (and zips) to be as small, neat and inconspicuous as possible; matching the fabric rather than being in contrast. Per Una clothes are my worst nightmare!",
    "Its VERY big! I would recommend sizing down x 2 - material light but not cotton but cool in warmer weather - can crease a lot",
    "Perfect fit; comfortable to wear. Looks good. Easy to wash. Love it so much I ordered it on two colours",
    "Feels like a work shirt, a few sizes up. Was expecting thicker material and the cuffs are a bit narrow for rolling up. But nice colour and collar is crisp"
