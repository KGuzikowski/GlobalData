  "short_description": "You have no idea how hard it is to resist a moon joke when talking (fine, writing!) about a toy for your butt called the Eclipse. True story. We'll tough it out, though, and just say that the Eclipse Remote Inflatable Probe might end up eclipsing some of the other anal toys in your collection. Aside from a classic p-spot seeking shape and twelve super powered vibration modes, the Inflatable features (surprise!) an inflatable shaft with four possible inflation modes. You'll be able to easily pump up and deflate your Eclipse any time you're craving some extra stretch - or less. As inner massage is in session, the Inflatable Probe's over-sized base seeks, finds and stimulates your or your partner's sensitive perineum. Twelve modes of shaft vibration and four of inflation are controlled using push button at the base, which is nice and wide to prevent any too-deep mishaps, or you can use the included wireless remote. USB rechargeable, the Eclipse Remote Inflatable Probe and the remote power up via an included dual USB charge cord. Two hours of charge time will thrill for up to 180 minutes. In hypoallergenic silicone, the Eclipse Remote Inflatable Probe is easy to clean before and after. Wash your Eclipse well with lots of warm soapy water, or use a favorite toy care fluid/foam. You will, of course, be using lots of lube with this toy, so be sure to choose a good quality water-based formula. Please don't be tempted to use a silicone lube - it could damage the surface of your silicone toy. On that note, it's best to keep this (and any silicone toy) away from other silicone products. The Eclipse Remote Inflatable Probe is not rated for use in water, so please keep it on dry land.",
