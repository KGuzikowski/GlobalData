This was priced right and it just works.", "Two of these do fit side by side in a keystone plate (some other types of keystone jacks don't).", "These Keystones worked perfectly for my needs. I am currently in the process of redoing my network closet and I decided to go with an actual patch panel that used keystones and I also rewired the home using in-wall keystones plates. I had no problems terminating my connection points throughout the home and the closet. I did notice that these keystones are not the 110 type but are the krone type, which wasn't a problem since I had that tool in my kit. Now I have much more ease and flexibility in case I have to repair or add additional cable.", "Great quality cat6 keystones, exactly what I needed.", "The worst keystone jacks I've ever used. Over a quarter of them failed and I still have some that lose the connection if the cable moves even a little. Pure crap.", "Great product. I Have used these several times. The fit and function are just what you would expect. Price is 1/4 of what the local stores wanted.", "Great cat6 jack at a great price.", "This keystone is narrower than others, allowing it to fit into Product #6837 (2-gang 12 position keystone wall plate) with no issues!
