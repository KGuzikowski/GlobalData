  "description": "If you were a teenager in the 90's, or if you've been watching Yellowjackets, you probably heard a certain song about being kissed by a rose. It pretty much defined the slow dance genre! Beso's Flower Power may not bring on any musical nostalgia, but it will bring on lots of orgasms, thanks to some very unique air-powered pulsation and a shape that surrounds your or your partner's sweet spots perfectly. Looking very much like it's namesake, the Flower Power features lots of easy-to-maneuver curviness and a lightweight design that's comfortable in your hand. Inside a widespread, petal-bedecked tip, a circular opening pinpoints even the smallest of your or your partner's outer sweet spots, from clitoris to nipples and beyond. Once it's in position, power up ten potential modes of throbbing, pulsing air pressure using one simple power/function button. Conveniently rechargeable via USB, the Flower Power includes a handy magnetic base charge cord. In medical grade silicone, the Flower Power Stimulator is hypoallergenic, non-reactive and safe for sensitive skin. It's also extra easy to clean with warm soapy water or a good toy care fluid/foam. This toy is compatible with any favorite water-based lube, but please avoid contact with silicone lubes and other silicone toys/products. Waterproof.",
