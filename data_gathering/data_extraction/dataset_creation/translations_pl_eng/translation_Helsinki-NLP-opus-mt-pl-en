Description
Life never ends, so get ready to continue. Powered by your energy watch with the visible Mads Dante mechanism will adapt to you, pace to pace. Do what others will not do today. So tomorrow you will be able to do what others cannot do. Thanks to your skeletal shield and display decelebrity you will have a place in the first row in the heart of the watch. Thanks to the durable sapphire crystal you do not have to worry about scratching. This man's watch uses energy through the natural movement of your wrist or you can manually film it. This means you will never buy (and you will have difficulty putting) a battery into your watch... leaving yourself more time to use this moment. Made of rust-resistant stainless steel in a golden shade with a matching black-golden stainless steel bracelet. The mechanism is in grey color and protected by a strong sapphire crystal. Designed in Denmark and sent in a natural gift box.
