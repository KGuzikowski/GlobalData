    "This is a very nice level kit. Straight Forward install and levels my 2019 Ram perfectly.",
    "Fit great was easy to install and makes the truck look good",
    "It was a simple hour to put on and easy.",
    "Truck looks much better after the install. Installation requires a strut spring compressor. I loaned one from Autozone for free! Installation time took about 2-3 hours.",
    "Simple but great quality kit. Eliminated the factory rake and now my truck sits level.",
    "I recently purchased a Rough Country Leveling kit for my 2006 Ford F-150 and I am very happy with my purchase. Only $60 and free shipping!",
    "Great leveling kit! The struts make the truck look great and didn't effect the ride would highly recommend!",
    "Excellent product. Truck looks great and price is very reasonable",
    "The factory rake in the Chevy Colorado is too much. Adding the Rough Country level kit makes the truck sit like it should be from the factory.",
    "This lift gave my 2017 titan a little above level for the front, just what I was looking for. This was a simple and easy kit to install and looks great!",
    "Put a Fisher V-plow on my Ford F-350. Thought it would carry it better! Needed to raise the front end. Looked at different options. Chose the 2'' leveling kit from Rough Country. Easy install.(I am an auto tech with air tools) Can be done at home would just take longer. Threw on a pair of Timbren load boosters and it all works great! Will give a thumbs up to the Rough Country leveling kits!",
    "I wanted something to give my truck a better stance compared to stock, but didn't want something obnoxious. This leveling kit was the perfect fit. The truck looks great, rides as good as factory, and the extra 2\" up front is nice. The stance is aggressive and I can not fit a larger tire. I had a shop do the work and the install took them 2 hours w/alignment. Highly recommend.",
    "The kit does exactly what it is supposed to do, level out the truck. However, if you're planning on installing new springs (like I did) at the same time, be prepared to use an internal spring compressor. Old springs sag and tend to compress even more with a leveling kit. Installing new springs at the time of the leveling kit install on an old truck is cheap insurance to ensure you get the look that you want.",
    "Took to my friends shop and easy install and the truck looks awesome",
    "Great product especially for the price. Levelled the truck out. Rides like factory.",
    "This kit gave me the look I wanted and for a great price."
