      "This is a very nice level kit. Straight Forward install and levels my 2019 Ram perfectly.",
      "Fit great was easy to install and makes the truck look good",
      "It was a simple hour to put on and easy.",
      "Truck looks much better after the install. Installation requires a strut spring compressor. I loaned one from Autozone for free! Installation time took about 2-3 hours.",
      "Simple but great quality kit. Eliminated the factory rake and now my truck sits level.",
      "I recently purchased a Rough Country Leveling kit for my 2006 Ford F-150 and I am very happy with my purchase. Only $60 and free shipping!",
      "Great leveling kit! The struts make the truck look great and didn't effect the ride would highly recommend!",
      "Excellent product. Truck looks great and price is very reasonable",
      "The factory rake in the Chevy Colorado is too much. Adding the Rough Country level kit makes the truck sit like it should be from the factory.",
      "The kit does exactly what it is supposed to do, level out the truck. However, if you're planning on installing new springs (like I did) at the same time, be prepared to use an internal spring compressor. Old springs sag and tend to compress even more with a leveling kit. Installing new springs at the time of the leveling kit install on an old truck is cheap insurance to ensure you get the look that you want.",
      "Great product especially for the price. Levelled the truck out. Rides like factory.",
      "This kit gave me the look I wanted and for a great price."
