      "It‚Äôs Umbridge. It‚Äôs the worlds favorite evil villain you just can‚Äôt go wrong having her. Wish I could find a giant one lol.",
      "Too pretty. Umbridge is not my favorite HP character by a long shot, but Hallmark made her pretty sweet (but a little too pretty) so I choose to see her as she was when she was a little girl!",
      "Dolores Umbridge. Loved her character in the movies and was glad to see an itty bitty of her. Looks great with all my others. Great quality of work."
