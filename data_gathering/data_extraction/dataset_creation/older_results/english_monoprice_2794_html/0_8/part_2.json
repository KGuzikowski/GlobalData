        "You can use Cat6A cables, however, you will be limited to Cat6 speeds since these jacks will only support Cat6 speeds at the highest. I would recommend using product number 15679, which will support Cat6A speeds.",
        "It will fit in that panel. They are .8in wide.",
        "Thank you for your question. Yes, this would work with 22 AWG cable.",
        "Yes. I used with CAT6 (monoprice #13674)",
        "Yes they will. I ordered this combination from Monoprice last fall to install in a client's home. Worked great. Also works with both Cat 5e and Cat 6 cable that was already installed in the home."
