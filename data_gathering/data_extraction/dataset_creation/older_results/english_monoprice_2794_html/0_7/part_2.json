    "Will this work with Cat6A cables or will they not fit/not perform ideally in this?  Raymond E L  on Jun 26, 2017  BEST ANSWER:  You can use Cat6A cables, however, you will be limited to Cat6 speeds since these jacks will only support Cat6 speeds at the highest. I would recommend using product number 15679, which will support Cat6A speeds.",

    "Will it fit in Leviton plate hardware?. Other keystones on this site directed to this one for Leviton.  A shopper  on Mar 29, 2021",
    "Does anyone know of a speed punch down tool that works well with these jacks? I have ordered two now like the SpeedTerm Tool for Networx SpeedTerm 180 Degree Keystone Jacks by Networx and the jacks do not fit. If I have to use one like the Cable Matters 110 Punch Down Tool with 110 blade that does each wire at a time then so be it but I was hoping for something faster since I have to do 100+ connections.
