  "opinions": [
    "They are rated for Cat6, but yes. I have used them on Cat5e.",
    "Yes, the keystone jack is actually slightly more white but is only noticeable if someone asks if they are the same color.",
    "They should work, although stranded wire is tougher to get fully punched down in the keystone. Solid wire is designed for in-wall applications with keystones. Stranded wire is typically better suited for patch cables since it's more flexible than solid wire.",
    "Thank you for your question. This would likely fit the Cat 6a cable but you would be limited to the Cat 6A speeds."
