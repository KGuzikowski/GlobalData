    "Will this work with Cat6A cables or will they not fit/not perform ideally in this?",
    "How wide is this jack? Will it fit with other jacks in a 24 port patch panel?",
    "Will this support 22awg CAT6 cable (Product #30668)?",
    "Hi, do you have the dimensional data for this keystone? IE, height, width, & depth please.",
    "Will this work with CAT6 24AWG stranded wire?",
    "Will this fit the Decor insert?",
    "I'm going to use this essentially to couple two cat6 cables. Do I use the A wiring scheme or the B wiring scheme? I'm in the U.S.",
    "Does anyone know of a speed punch down tool that works well with these jacks? I have ordered two now like the SpeedTerm Tool for Networx SpeedTerm 180 Degree Keystone Jacks by Networx and the jacks do not fit. If I have to use one like the Cable Matters 110 Punch Down Tool with 110 blade that does each wire at a time then so be it but I was hoping for something faster since I have to do 100+ connections."
