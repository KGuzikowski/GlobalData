    "Scary game. do not play at night seriously",
    "Well, what can I say? It's a Playstation 1 title. So with that said, I guess you would have to be a \"retro-gamer\" and an Alien fan like myself to fully enjoy the game. The main reason that I purchased this Playstation 1 game was because I am a HUGE Alien movie franchise fan. Plus, there aren't any video games of this nature available for my Wii or Playstation 2 game consoles. As in, no Aliens first person shooter (FPS) games for either system. As for the game, it's your basic first person shooter (FPS) video game. I rate it as good, as the graphics and the game controls are a lot better then it's predecessor, Alien Triolgy. I really only suggest this game to  die-hard Alien fans that want a challenging controlled game and can stomach the large pixels of a Playstation 1 game. Though, this time around, both the graphics and controls are a bit more tolerable, but not by much. Buy at your own risk.",
    "I needed replacement cases for Aliens Trilogy and Alien Resurrection as I had purchased the discs but they didn't come in their original cases. And if you're looking to get the original cases get ready to shell out some money. Well I jumped on eBay and saw these beauties and they completely fit the bill. Plus they even included artwork for the inside! I couldn't be happier!",
    "Although 'Alien Resurrection' is dated(original PlayStationI), the game concept and easy functionality makes it still one of the best game titles ever.IMO Other first person shooters in a war setting like 'Call of Duty' or 'SOCOM: Navy Seals' are ok, but I prefer this genre of action, adventure, suspense. That is why I like practically everything about it and would rate it in the top 5 games. Maybe 'Splinter Cell' or 'Dead Space' could beat it but not much else. The game coincides with the movie of the same name and you play first as Ripley then Call(Wynona Rider's character) then back to Ripley and so on. There are two other playable characters: DiStephano(a Marine assigned to duty on the USM Auriga) and Christie(a mercenary an  d crewmember of the Betty which is how Call is also aboard the Auriga). The game starts with Ripley in a containment cell somewhere aboard the USM Auriga and, contacting and switching to the other players as you go, you must find your way through the ship. All the while, of course, trying not to get killed by facehuggers, chestbursters, aliens, bigger and meaner aliens, alien queen, and a nasty thing called a newborn. Unless you are very good, at some point in time, you will have been facehugged and counting down until an alien bursts from your chest! That and other things like the dark, shadowy scenery and secondary noises that go off at the worst times is why I like it so much and decided to buy it. The only thing I could find fault with is the lack of new events that are different after you save, begin new or get killed. AI is the term I guess."
