    "For the price you can't beat it of course if you have money always get what you can afford but if you don't have much money buy this one",
    "It works. It's noisy. Not studio quality by any stretch..",
    "nice chorus pedal, sounds great and easy to use , however, mine makes a \"pop\" sound when engaged. the foot switch is a true bypass but is not wired in an optimal way. Correcting the switch wiring proved difficult because the switch is soldered directly to the pc card, and the card is double sided. So here is an easy solution to this problem and no more popping. the 2 resistors are 2.2 Meg. I included a photo for the location of the resistors. Works great now!  two 2.2 Meg resistors",
