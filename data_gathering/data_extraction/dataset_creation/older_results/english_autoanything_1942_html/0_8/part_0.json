  "description": "If you’re looking to convert your classic street machine into a high-performance beast with EFI-scale performance, the MSD Atomic EFI Throttle Body Kit is a must-have. Easy to install and set up, it’s suitable for application on vehicles already equipped with a high-pressure electric fuel pump, regulator and return line. The basic kit is comprised of a power module, wide-band O2 sensor, harnesses, handheld programmer and the throttle body itself, into which the ECU and built-in sensors have been integrated. As a result, the Atomic has fewer wiring connections than competing systems, and you don’t have to mount a bulky ECU. Initial timing is taken care of via the compact, also handheld monitor – just answer a few questions about your engine and get rolling. Your MSD EFI Throttle Body Kit carries a limited warranty.",
