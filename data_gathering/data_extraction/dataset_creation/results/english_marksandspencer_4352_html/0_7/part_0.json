    "Lovely shirt fits perfectly, well made and good value.",
    "Large oversized shirt ordered a ten was still too big and colours darker than advertised sent back",
    "Lovely shirt; well made and washes beautifully. It is definitely an oversized fit which is what I wanted but I would have sized down for something a bit more professional looking. I don’t like the buttons, I think they’re too large but they’re sewn on well with thread that matches the shirt fabric. That’s me being particular though because I always prefer buttons (and zips) to be as small, neat and inconspicuous as possible; matching the fabric rather than being in contrast. Per Una clothes are my worst nightmare!",
    "Its VERY big! I would recommend sizing down x 2 - material light but not cotton but cool in warmer weather - can crease a lot",
    "It’s a lovely It was massive. I know it’s described as oversized but you needs size tote o smaller than usual. Returning sadly and smaller sizes out of stock!"
