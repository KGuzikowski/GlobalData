    "not much to say... strip the outer skin of the wire, follow the color codes, punchdown the wires, snap into a wall plate, then you're in business. This was priced right and it just works.",
    "Worked Well. Reasonably easy to install with a punchdown tool. Two of these do fit side by side in a keystone plate (some other types of keystone jacks don't).",
    "I bought the wrong quick terminator tool. I was forced to start buying this type. They work fine in the Jack termination tool. Line up the wires place in the tool and one grip click and your set. put the caps on and install into the decor face",
    "These Keystones worked perfectly for my needs. I am currently in the process of redoing my network closet and I decided to go with an actual patch panel that used keystones and I also rewired the home using in-wall keystones plates. I had no problems terminating my connection points throughout the home and the closet. I did notice that these keystones are not the 110 type but are the krone type, which wasn't a problem since I had that tool in my kit. Now I have much more ease and flexibility in case I have to repair or add additional cable.",
    "The worst keystone jacks I've ever used. Over a quarter of them failed and I still have some that lose the connection if the cable moves even a little. Pure crap.",
    "Great quality cat6 keystones, exactly what I needed.",
    "Great product. I Have used these several times. The fit and function are just what you would expect. Price is 1/4 of what the local stores wanted.",
    "This keystone is narrower than others, allowing it to fit into Product #6837 (2-gang 12 position keystone wall plate) with no issues! These worked great for my application and punched down just fine."
